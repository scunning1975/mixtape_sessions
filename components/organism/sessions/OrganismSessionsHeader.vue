            I believe in democratizing causal inference methods, and try to do so through writing and teaching. Covid showed that it’s possible to teach people using technology.

            Several times a year, I and some others will provide short workshops aimed to train others in skills based contemporary causal methodology at prices that we hope can accommodate a range of people with differing ability and willingness to pay through bundling and price discrimination, as well as with unique add ons like office hours.

These “in person workshops” can be worked out directly with my assistant, <a class="text-violet-red-600 hover:text-violet-red-700" href="causalinf@mixtape.consulting@mixtape.consulting">Emmi Scott</a>.
